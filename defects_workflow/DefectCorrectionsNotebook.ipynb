    "# Finite-size corrections to charged defect supercells with FHI-aims\n",
    "This notebook is designed for applying finite-size corrections to charged defect supercells using outputs from the [FHI-aims](https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/) electronic structure software package and the FNV correction scheme (doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.016402) through integration with the CoFFEE python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First download and install CoFFEE from [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465518300158).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps below are designed to allow for easier and consistent processing of large sets of defect calculations. \n",
    "All user defined settings are in the first cell. All subsequent cells do not require user inputs. They just need to be run in order and there is an explanation of the analysis being performed before each cell. Each charged defect still needs to be processed one at a time by specifying the location of directories with the relevant data in the 'User inputs' cell. The user must then extract the correction energy from the potential alignment plot at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions made during the processing\n",
    "1. The user is using python3 and has successfully installed the CoFFEE package and its dependencies\n",
    "2. The electronic and ionic components of the host crystal have already been computed by the user\n",
    "3. All defects are intrinsic defects (there are no atom types present in the defect supercell that are not also present in the perfect supercell)\n",
    "4. The volume of the supercells has not been relaxed so lattice vectors are the same for the perfect and defect supercells (this is appropriate for simulating defects in the dilute limit)\n",
    "5. The supercells have orthogonal axes for the lattice vectors (some numerical noise in the off-diagonals is okay)\n",
    "6. A maximum of one point defect is present in each supercell\n",
    "7. All filenames for FHI-aims calculations still have their original default names: 'geometry.in' and 'plane_average_realspace_ESP.out'\n",
    "8. The data from all final one-shot calculations of the perfect and defect supercells are stored in one directory (one-shot meaning no relaxation steps were performed on the final structure so the only geometry files are 'geometry.in' and this corresponds to the final relaxed structures). Sub-directories within this directory are fine and are to be expected to keep data organised!\n",
    "9. The same sigma value is used for the charge model for all defects in the same set for consistency, but note that in reality the charge associated with some defects may be more or less disperse\n",
